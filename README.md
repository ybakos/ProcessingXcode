Processing for Xcode
====================

This is a boilerplate Java/Processing 2 project for Xcode 5.

Not safe for public consumption. There are some environment-specific project attributes to work out.

To use this, you should:

* update the custom build tool path to your ant binary
 * click on the ProcessingSketch project in the sidebar
 * under the Info tab, modify the Build Tool to match your ant binary location
* copy Processing's core.jar to the lib directory inside the project directory tree
